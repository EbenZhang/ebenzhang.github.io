It's a well known fact that looking at a candidate's past behaviour is the best way to predict their future performance.

So don't waste any more precious interview time asking hypothetical questions. Behavioural interview questions will let you understand in detail how a candidate has acted in specific situations.

First, identify the core behaviours you'd like your candidates to  demonstrate. Then you can then select your specific questions from the list below.

Remember to assess all candidates against the same behavioural criteria!



### ABILITY TO HANDLE STRESS

- What has been the most stressful situation you have ever found yourself in at work? How did you handle it?
