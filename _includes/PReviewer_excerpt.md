**PReviewer** is a desktop application designed to review github pull requests. The key feature is the ability to view differences in external diff tools such as [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com), [KDiff](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/), [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org) or whatever you like.
